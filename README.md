### LLM-RGPD

# Tools : Python, LLama2 ( GGML version ), LangChain, Streamlit
*( GGML is a format for LLM's created to run inference (text completion) on CPU's : Quantized model)

The primary objective of this application is to ensure the anonymity of text by masking all personal information, including but not limited to names, phone numbers, addresses, emails, and banking details.

LLM-RGPD leverages the power of Few-Shot Learning, a prominent technique in Prompt Engineering. This technique allows us to provide the LLM with additional context in the form of examples, thereby enhancing control over the LLM's output.

 For further refinement, we have the capability to employ a Self-Ask prompt and add Regular Expressions (RE) for a broader range of categories...
